# Fuzzy-Kmeans-Data-Imputation
Anybody who has worked in data science will know that missing data is a curse. We have found ways to get around this problem with a veriety of data imputation techniques, for example meanimputation, median imputation, mode imputation, regression imputation, grouped median imputation etc. One very efficient way to impute data is fuzzyKmeans data imputation. Unfortunately I couldn't find a python implementation. Here's my venture make one. This research paper has the theory behind this implementation. https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-25929-9_70
